(I Wanna Shout That I Love You)


The glaring sunlight is to my back, as I start running in the town
It gets blocked like always
Although there’s no reason why I’m crazy for you
I haven’t linked with your arm yet

Before I knew it, my eyes have started to be captured
I won’t leave you, I won’t waver, Crazy for you

I wanna shout that I love you, I’ll try to change tomorrow
I wanna smash the time frozen solid
I wanna shout that I love you, I’ll step out with courage
I want you to accept my passionate thought

On the noisy floor, across the crowded table
I’m spellbound by your casual eyes
As if being in love, as if being allowed to dance
I won’t lie to my throbbing heartbeats anymore

When will it change? This irritating friendship
I can’t reach you, I want to confirm it, I take you away

I wanna shout that I love you, I might cast everything away
I wanna start finding words that melt your heart
I wanna shout that I love you, I won’t go home tonight
I’ll make the days of just staring at you end, I wanna cry for you

I wanna shout that I love you, I’ll try to change tomorrow
I wanna smash the time frozen solid
I wanna shout that I love you, I’ll step out with courage
I want you to accept my passionate thought

I wanna cry for you
